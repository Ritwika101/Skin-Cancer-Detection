# Skin-Cancer-Detection
Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks algorithms is done to detect whether the skin disease is benign or malignant. The final model used is MobileNetV2 with an accuracy of 83.9%. There are various architectures of CNNs available which have been key in building algorithms which power and shall power AI as a whole in the foreseeable future. Some of them which I have implemented using Transfer Learning are listed below:
1. ResNet
2. MobileNetV2

After doing some Fine tuning to the MobileNetV2, the accuracy was almost the same, that is why the final model chosen for this Skin cancer images classification is th MobileNetV2 with an accuracy of 83.9%.
